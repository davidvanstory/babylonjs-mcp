 https://github.com/VibeCAD/gui this is the repo that I want to integrate my MCP with. can you ultrathink through how I can approach using my MCP with this gui?\
  I want to be able to connect to the mcp so that the user inputs text into the "Natural Language Commands" and that text is used by the mcp to create bablyon 3d 
  objects.
