I'll create a red box for you using the Babylon.js tools.Let me try again with the basic parameters:It seems there might be an issue with the Babylon.js environment. Let me check what objects are currently in the scene:It appears the Babylon.js MCP service might not be properly initialized or there's a connection issue. The error suggests that the response object doesn't have the expected structure.

You may need to:
1. Check if the Babylon.js MCP server is running
2. Verify the connection to the MCP service
3. Ensure the Babylon.js environment is properly set up

Would you like me to try a different approach or help you troubleshoot the MCP connection?
